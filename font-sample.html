    <h1> Time </h1>
    <h2> By Pink Floyd </h2>
    <p> <br>Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day <br />
<br> Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way <br />
<br> Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown <br />
<br> Waiting for someone or something to show you the way <br /> <p>
     
    <p> <br> Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain <br />
<br> You are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today <br />
<br> And then one day you find ten years have got behind you <br />
<br> No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun <br />
        
     <p> <br> And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking <br />
<br> Racing around to come up behind you again <br />
<br> The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older <br />
<br> Shorter of breath and one day closer to death <br />
      
     <p> <br> Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time <br />
<br> Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines <br />
<br> Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way <br />
<br> The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say <br />
         
      <p> <br> Home, home again <br />
<br> I like to be here when I can <br />
<br> And when I come home cold and tired <br />
<br> It's good to warm my bones beside the fire <br />
       
     <p> <br> Far away across the field <br />
<br> The tolling of the iron bell <br />
<br> Calls the faithful to their knees <br />
<br> To hear the softly spoken magic spells <br />
